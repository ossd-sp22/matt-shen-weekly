title: "Week 1: Diving into Open Source"
---


This week, I learned about what an "open source" project is, including: their creation, maintenance, and licensing. When I hear the term "open source," I think of a communal, shared project that pools together different people and their experience to improve the project. One obvious advantage of open source is the accessibility to multiple people of different backgrounds and specialities. People all over the world can contribute to a project, and anyone can improve it. Eventhough this sounds great on paper, there are some major disadvantages to open source. Because the project is online and avaliable to everyone to use, the creator must relinquish all rights to the project, thereby making it difficult to market. Additionally, because of the complexity and difficulty of some projects, it may seem difficult to contribute and improve, as a broader understanding of the project may be needed to help fix an issue. Some propular open source projects I have used and still continue to use are: Twitter Bootstrap for HTML configuration, Java for coding, Firefox as a search engine, and Wikipedia as a data bank.
