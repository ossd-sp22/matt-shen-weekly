## Git Exercises
Personally, I would call myself a beginner to Git and Github. My only experience using git/github was as a means to submit assignments/projects for some NYU cs classes. That being said, I know how to clone, add, commit, and push to github. I have had no hands-on experience with pulling, forking, or using github in a collaborative setting. <!--more--> This past week, there was a step-by-step github exercise to walk new users (like myself) though the process of collaborative git. The exercise entailed cloning, forking, modifying, pulling, comitting, and pushing a sample repository. This exercise was intended to teach users the proper methods, and how to use git effectively. Additionally, it stressed the importance of pulling, and problem solving if the repository has been changed or modified since the previous clone.
