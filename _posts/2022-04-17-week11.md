## Open Source in Industries
This week, we watched a video that interviewed Larry Gritz of Sony Pictures ImageWorks and Carol Payne of Netflix. They talked about open source in the film industry. They discussed about how it was more common for companies to buy software or develop it in-house previously, but now companies are leaning more towards open source options. For example, the Academy Software Foundation, and its ties to the Oscars. Additionally, companies have been gravitating towards open source because of the speed open source projects. Companies can see if the project can be used to their application cheaply, and if the project can fit its needs. Additionally, open souce allows for a large array of talent. Through open source, companies can find candidates with skill sets that fit their needs percisely.

## Zulip
This week, we continued working on our pull request. We found the error that was failing the test, and fixed it. We also resubmitted the pull request and began working on anohter issue. This new issue is about inputitng the phone number. Our main issue right now is finding the code that corresponds to the issue. The documentation is very confusing and we can't find where the code is.
