title: "Week 12: Continuing Group Work"

## Project Presentations
This week, we had group presentations, where each group would present their group's progress. It was nice seeing where everyone is, and the unique experience all the groups had. I was able to relate to a lot of their obstacles and successes as well. I was most surprised to see that many of the groups were hopping on calls and meetings with project admins/developers which is really cool. It seems like some projects are really welcoming and wholesome.

## Group Work
Currently, we have completely redone and resubmitted the first pull request. We ran into a few problems regarding access to the issue. Because it has been about 8 days after we first claimed the issue, the zulip bot has unassigned us to the issue, so we are unable to submit it. We have sent a message into the development help zulip chat. Additionally, I am working on the second issue. My previous message was answered, and i am able to find where the code is... but it is still really confusing. I think the process of making a specific phone number input would require us to create a new input type. Currently, all the inputs are SHORT_TEXT which is basically strings. I am looking into creating a new input type to better fit the phone number needs. It seems much more difficult than anticipated though because these input types need to be referenced amongst many of the files.
