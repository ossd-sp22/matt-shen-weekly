title: "Week 13: Guest Speaker and Presentations"
---
## Guest Speaker
This week, we had Riju Khatri as our guest speaker. She was really relatable, being an NYU student studying for a master's degree. She was around our age, so it was definitely more different than our past guest speakers. Additionally, she doesn't work for one project specifically. She contributes to projects that interest her, and that felt more like something i would want to persue after college. She simply chooses to contribute when she wants at her own pace, rather than being forced to a specific task. 

## Presentations
All the presentations were so good this week. I felt like I am so behind on my PR's. However, it seemed like all the other groups had amazing communities and not many issues. They were all very communicative with the admins, often having meetings and calls with them. Though my group has had many interactions with the community/developers, we didn't achieve this level of intamacy that all these groups achieved; which was a bit disappointing. However, i am excited to present next week, and see other presentations as well.
